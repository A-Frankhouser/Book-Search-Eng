# Book Search Engine
## Description
This is a book search website that allows a user to create an account, search for books, and also save the books that they like to their own collection! When the user visits the website for the first time they will have the option to search for books, login, or sign up. Even though the user has the option to search for books before signing up or logging in, they won't be able to save books until they log in. <br>
Once users have signed up or logged in then they will be able to save books, view their collection and also delete books from their collection.
