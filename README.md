# Book Search Engine

This is a book search website that allows a user to create an account, search for books, and also save the books that they like to their own collection! When the user visits the website for the first time they will have the option to search for books, login, or signup. Even though the user has the option to search for books before sigining up or logging in, they won't be able to save books until they log in. <br>
